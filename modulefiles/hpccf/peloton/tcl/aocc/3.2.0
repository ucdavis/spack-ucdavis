module-whatis " The AOCC compiler system is a high performance, production quality code generation tool. The AOCC environment provides various options to developers when building and optimizing C, C++, and Fortran applications targeting 32-bit and 64-bit Linux platforms. The AOCC compiler system offers a high level of advanced optimizations, multi-threading and processor support that includes global optimization, vectorization, inter-procedural analyses, loop transformations, and code generation. AMD also provides highly optimized libraries, which extract the optimal performance from each x86 processor core when utilized. The AOCC Compiler Suite simplifies and accelerates development and tuning for x86 applications."
