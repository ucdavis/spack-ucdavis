module-whatis "The Process Management Interface (PMI) has been used for quite some time as a means of exchanging wireup information needed for interprocess communication. However, meeting the significant orchestration challenges presented by exascale systems requires that the process-to-system interface evolve to permit a tighter integration between the different components of the parallel application and existing and future SMS solutions."
